    "I iterate through the list of words to check for subsequence matches. If there is a match, I increment a counter variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check for a subsequence match, I use a greedy strategy: if the first letter of s and the word match, I consume the first letter of both. Once one of the variables has been fully consumed, I can check to see if the word has been consumed. Logically, iff the word has been consumed, then there is a subsequence match; I can increment a counter variable.\n",
